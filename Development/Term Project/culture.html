			<h2>Culture</h2>
			<h3>Food</h3>

				It is characterized by extensive use of seafood and dairy products, which results from its historical reliance on its seaports and fishing 
				industry, as well as extensive dairy farming in inland regions. Many of New England's earliest Puritan settlers were from eastern England, 
				where baking foods such as pies, beans, and turkey were more common than frying as was the tradition elsewhere. Two prominent characteristic 
				foodstuffs native to New England are maple syrup and cranberries. The traditional standard starch is potato, though rice has a somewhat 
				increased popularity in modern cooking. Although known for limited spices aside from ground black pepper, parsley and sage are common, with a 
				few Caribbean additions like nutmeg. Due to the reliance on dairy, creams are standard. The favored cooking techniques are stewing, steaming, 
				and baking.

				New England also has strong literary roots, having been the birthplace of many famous authors such as 
				Ralph Waldo Emerson, born in Boston. Henry David Thoreau was born in Concord, Massachusetts, where he lived, for some time, 
				by Walden Pond, on Emerson's land. Nathaniel Hawthorne, romantic era writer, was born in historical Salem. Another famous author, Herman Melville,
				originally from New York, came to New England and moved into Pittsfield, Massachusetts to write his novel <em>Moby Dick</em>. A more modern author, Stephen
				King, was born in Portland, Maine and has used Maine as the setting in many of his stories.

			<h3>Religion</h3>
			<p>

				<div id="p1">
				Today, New England is the least religious part of the U.S. In 2009, less than half of those polled in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and 
				Vermont claimed that religion was an important part of their daily lives. In Connecticut and Rhode Island, also among the ten least religious 
				states, 55 and 53 percent, respectively, of those polled claimed that it was. According to the American Religious Identification Survey, 34
				percent of Vermonters, a plurality, claimed to have no religion; on average, nearly one out of every four New Englanders identifies as having 
				no religion, more than in any other part of the U.S. New England had one of the highest percentages of Catholics in the U.S. This number 
				declined from 50% in 1990 to 36% in 2008.

			<h3>Music</h3>
			<p><img src="DickDale.jpg" title="Dick Dale, surf rock guitarist from Quincy, MA" class="image-right" style="height: 425px; width: 325px;"></p>
			<p>
				New England was for some time an important center of American classical music. The Second New England School was instrumental in reinvigorating
				the tradition in the U.S. Prominent modernist composers also come from the region, including Charles Ives and John Adams. Boston is the site of
				the New England Conservatory, the Yale School of Music and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
				<br />
				<br />
				In rock music, the region has produced bands as different as Aerosmith, Phish, the Pixies, and Boston. Dick Dale, a Quincy, Massachusetts native, 
				helped popularize surf rock. The region has also become a hotbed for Hardcore Punk and Heavy Metal music (especially with regards to Metalcore 
				and Deathcore).

			<h3>Social Activities</h3>
			<p><img src="NEsocial.jpg" title="Opera houses and theaters, like the Vergennes Opera House in Vergennes, Vermont, are popular in New England towns." 
			class="image-left" style="height: 300px; width: 400px;"></p>
			<p>
				In much of rural New England, particularly Maine, Acadian and Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois culture are included in music and dance. Contra dancing and country square dancing are popular throughout New England, usually backed by live Irish, Acadian, or other folk music.
				<br />
				<br />
				Opera houses and theaters, like the Vergennes Opera House in Vergennes, Vermont, are popular in New England towns.
				Traditional knitting, quilting and rug hooking circles in rural New England have become less common; church, sports, and town government are 
				more typical social activities. These traditional gatherings are often hosted in individual homes or civic centers; larger groups regularly 
				assemble at special-purpose ice cream parlors that dot the countryside. New England leads the U.S. in ice cream consumption per capita.
				<br />
				<br />
				In the U.S., candlepin bowling is essentially confined to New England, where it was invented in the 19th century.

			<h3>Art</h3>
			<p><img src="NEart.jpg" title="New England Scenery by Thomas Cole 1839" class="image-right" style="height: 425px; width: 350px;"></p>
			<p>
				New England is also justly famous for the art it has produced, particularly the seascapes painted on Cape Cod, along the coast of Maine, as 
				well as those by Hudson River School artists such as Thomas Cole and his student Frederic Church. Some of the other artists who have memorably
				painted New England landscapes and seascapes include Winslow Homer (1836-1910), John Marin (1870-1953), Fairfield Porter (1907-1975), 
				Neil Welliver (1929-2005), and Andrew Wyeth (b. 1917), the latter of the iconic Christina's World, painted in a coastal Maine field.
